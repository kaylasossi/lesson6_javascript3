### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. One of the lessons I learned is creating document nodes. To do this you must use the createElement() method of the document object. 
2. Another lesson I learned is the for-loop method. For loops through a block of code a number of times. In the assignment, we ran the loop 3 times. 
3. Last lesson I learned was the appendChild(). This method appends a node as the last child of a node. We used it to add the img element as a child of the figure element to match the nesting of the
existing figure and img elements in the photo gallery app.
